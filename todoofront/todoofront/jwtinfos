ENCRYPTION KEY GENERATION FOR JWT
First, make a new directory to hold the keys:

mkdir var/jwt

Next, copy the second line to create a private key, but change its path to the var/jwt directory:

openssl genrsa -out var/jwt/private.pem -aes256 4096

This asks you for a password - give it one! It adds another layer of security in case somebody gets your private key. I'll use happyapi. Perfect!

Last step: copy the final line and remove app at the beginning and the end to point to the var/jwt directory:

openssl rsa -pubout -in var/jwt/private.pem -out var/jwt/public.pem
